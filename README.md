📌 Project Overview
This project simulates the role of a land data analyst by evaluating off-market land across U.S. counties. Inspired by real-world pricing work at companies like Dirt for Dollars (DFD), I built a comparative pricing report and interactive dashboard that highlights trends in land value, informs offer strategies, and supports data-driven acquisition decisions.

Using comps (comparable property sales), I created offer ranges based on factors like acreage, access, and location. The project demonstrates my ability to transform raw real estate data into clear, actionable insights.

🎯 Goals
Analyze public property data to determine fair land value

Build a pricing system for land investment analysis

Track high- and low-performing counties over time

Develop an investor-friendly dashboard that visualizes value ranges and market trends

🔧 Tools & Skills Used
Microsoft Excel – for data cleaning, price logs, and comp analysis

Tableau – for creating an interactive land value dashboard

Zillow, Redfin, LandWatch – for sourcing public sales and property data

Comparative sales (comping) – to assign value estimates to undeveloped land

Market research – to track county-level performance and identify strong leads

📊 Dashboard Features
Land value breakdown by acreage, zip code, and road access

Visual comparison of “hot” vs. “cold” counties based on price activity

Filters for property characteristics and location-based sorting

Offer range calculator for evaluating investment potential

💡 What I Learned
How to comp raw land with minimal data

Techniques used by land flippers and real estate investors to evaluate risk

How to build clean, insightful dashboards for fast decision-making

The importance of pricing accuracy in real estate strategy
